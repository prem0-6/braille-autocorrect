# Braille Autocorrect

A simple Braille input auto-correct and suggestion tool.  
This project helps users who type Braille using a standard QWERTY keyboard, by suggesting the closest correct word from a dictionary, even if there are typos or mistakes in the input.

- Suggests the most likely intended word based on Braille input, even with errors.
- Maps QWERTY keys (D, W, Q, K, O, P) to Braille dot positions.
- Simple and beginner-friendly logicâ€”no advanced algorithms required.
- Fast and lightweight (C++).

## How it Works

- Users type Braille letters using specific QWERTY keys (for example, `D K|D|D O K` for the word "cat").
- The program checks the input against a dictionary of valid words.
- It calculates the number of differences and suggests the closest match, helping visually impaired users avoid mistakes.

## Usage
1. Compile:
    ```
    g++ braille-autocorrect.cpp -o braille-autocorrect
    ```
2. Run:
    ```
    ./braille-autocorrect
    ```

3. Enter your Braille input when prompted.  
   Example for "cat":

If you type:D K|D|D O
output would be : Did you mean: cat?
